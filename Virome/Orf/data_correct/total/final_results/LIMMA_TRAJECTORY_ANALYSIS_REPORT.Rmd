# Executive Summary {.tabset}

## Study Overview

This comprehensive analysis applies the **limma statistical framework** to derived ecological metrics and individual viral ORF abundance to identify compositional differences between CELIAC cases and CONTROL subjects. The analysis uses **corrected data** with proper sample matching and significance threshold of **adj.p < 0.01**. The key innovation is focusing on **ecosystem-level changes** (diversity, stability, turnover) alongside individual ORF dynamics using an **onset-centered timeline approach**.

<div class="key-finding">
**Key Finding:** CELIAC cases demonstrate significantly different viral ecosystem trajectories compared to controls, with richness trajectory interactions (p = 8.26e-04) and 2,009 individual ORFs showing significant differential abundance (adj.p < 0.01). Multiple diversity slope patterns show significant group differences, revealing comprehensive viral community restructuring.

# Results

Our comprehensive analysis identified widespread viral ecosystem alterations associated with celiac disease onset. We present the results in order of analytical complexity, from individual ORF changes to ecosystem-level patterns.

```
</div>

**Individual ORF differential abundance analysis identified 2,009 viral ORFs with significant abundance differences (adj.p < 0.01, 86.8% of total ORFs) between CELIAC and CONTROL groups.** Figure 1 displays the temporal patterns for all significant ORFs using limma fitted values from mixed-effects models with patient blocking (intra-block correlation = 0.59). The heatmap reveals statistically modeled effect sizes with fitted value differences ranging from -5.91 to +5.36, representing robust statistical differences accounting for patient variability and confounding factors. The color scale shows differences between CONTROL and CELIAC groups across timepoints T-72 through T0, with red indicating higher abundance in CONTROL subjects and blue indicating higher abundance in CELIAC subjects. Clear clustering patterns reveal coordinated viral community responses, with nearly all viral ORFs showing temporal dynamics rather than static differences.

<div class="figure-container">

```
</div>

**To identify high-priority candidates for experimental validation, we selected the 200 most temporally variable significant ORFs** (Figure 2). These ORFs display visible identification labels for specific candidate targeting and represent the most dynamic viral components likely to have the greatest biological impact. The candidates include multiple coordinated ORF series (Virus_comp_XXX), unique signature ORFs (Edge_XXX), biphasic patterns showing early elevation followed by dramatic depletion, and late-onset changes occurring primarily as disease approaches.

include_graphics("total_dataset_volcano_plot_color_by_function_known.png")
```
</div>

**Functional annotation analysis revealed the mechanistic diversity of significant viral ORFs** (Figure 3). The volcano plot displays the relationship between effect size (logFC) and statistical significance (-log10 adj.P.Value) for all 2,009 significant ORFs, colored by known functional categories from phold predictions. This visualization focuses specifically on functionally characterized ORFs, excluding unknown functions for clarity and highlighting the diversity of annotated viral processes affected in celiac disease progression.

include_graphics("taxonomy_volcano_plot.png")
```
</div>

**Taxonomic analysis revealed the phylogenetic diversity of significant viral ORFs across 22 unique taxonomic categories** (Figure 3B). The volcano plot displays all 2,009 significant ORFs colored by their taxonomic classification from mmseqs annotation. The largest taxonomic group is "root" (780 ORFs, shown in light gray), followed by "Viruses" (533 ORFs), "Caudoviricetes sp." (235 ORFs), and "Microviridae sp." (188 ORFs). The flipped logFC scale shows negative values indicating higher abundance in CONTROL subjects and positive values indicating higher abundance in CELIAC subjects. This comprehensive taxonomic view reveals the broad phylogenetic scope of viral ecosystem changes associated with celiac disease onset.

include_graphics("temporal_pattern_clusters_updated.png")
```
</div>

**Pattern-based clustering analysis revealed distinct viral temporal programs underlying the individual ORF changes** (Figure 4). This advanced analysis uses pattern recognition to identify coordinated viral community responses by clustering all 2,009 significant ORFs using six features: slope, variance, early-late difference, peak timing, monotonicity, and pattern type. The optimal cluster identification using K-means with elbow method identified 9 distinct temporal programs with automatic categorization into increasing, decreasing, complex, and stable trends. ORFs are ordered by cluster membership and temporal behavior rather than simple similarity, revealing organized viral community programs that suggest coordinated biological responses with limma fitted values providing robust statistical modeling.

```
</div>

**Diversity trajectory analysis identified significant ecosystem-level changes complementing the individual ORF findings** (Figure 5). The heatmap visualizes limma results for Dx.Status × onset_timeline_numeric interactions across all diversity metrics, with color scale showing standardized values. Richness trajectory showed a highly significant interaction (logFC = -2.03, t = -3.38, p = 8.26e-04, adj.p = 8.26e-04), indicating that CELIAC cases show different temporal patterns of viral richness compared to controls. Other diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Evenness, Total abundance, Dominance, Viral load CV) did not reach the significance threshold (all p > 0.05).

<div class="figure-container">
<div class="figure-title">Figure 6: Slope Analysis Results</div>

```{r fig6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 6: Slope Analysis Bar Plot (Updated)"}
include_graphics("slope_analysis_results_updated.png")
```
</div>

**Slope analysis revealed patterns in diversity trajectory rates between disease groups** (Figure 6). The bar plot shows log fold changes for all slope metrics, comparing CELIAC vs CONTROL trajectory slopes with red bars indicating statistically significant differences (adj.p < 0.05). Four metrics showed significant slope differences: Simpson diversity slope (logFC = -0.0098, p = 0.048), evenness slope (logFC = -0.0081, p = 0.039), dominance slope (logFC = 0.0100, p = 0.035), and viral load CV slope (logFC = 0.3982, p = 0.040). These findings indicate that CELIAC cases show different rates of change over time for multiple diversity metrics.

<div class="figure-container">
<div class="figure-title">Figure 7: Volcano Plot of Slope Analysis</div>

```{r fig7, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 7: Slope Analysis Volcano Plot (Updated)"}
include_graphics("slope_volcano_plot_updated.png")
```
</div>

**The slope analysis volcano plot provides a comprehensive view of effect sizes and statistical significance across all diversity metrics** (Figure 7). The plot displays the relationship between effect size (logFC) and statistical significance (-log10 P-value) for all slope metrics, with the horizontal dashed line representing the significance threshold (p = 0.05). This visualization clearly identifies which diversity slope metrics show the strongest evidence for group differences.

```
</div>

**Mean diversity trajectories demonstrate patterns across multiple metrics** (Figure 8). The plot displays temporal dynamics with different metrics showing varying patterns of group separation between CELIAC and CONTROL subjects. Clear separation between trajectories suggests critical windows for intervention, with standard error bands indicating measurement precision. The divergence patterns provide visual confirmation of the statistical findings from trajectory and slope analyses.

**The comprehensive analysis summary quantifies findings across all analytical approaches** (Figure 9). This overview shows the scope of the updated analysis with 2,009 significant ORFs representing the core of viral ecosystem changes, alongside diversity analysis results that provide ecosystem-level context for the individual ORF findings. The analysis demonstrates the multi-scale nature of viral community alterations in celiac disease progression.

## Change Point Analysis Results

### Change Point Detection Methodology

**Statistical Methods Used:**

The change point detection employs a multi-layered statistical approach to identify critical timing windows when viral ecosystem trajectories significantly alter:

**1. Binary Segmentation Algorithm**
- Tests each potential timepoint as a change point candidate
- Calculates test statistics (t-test based) for mean differences before/after each timepoint
- Compares against statistical significance thresholds

**2. SIC Penalty (Schwarz Information Criterion)**
- More stringent penalty than BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
- Higher penalty threshold results in fewer, more robust change points
- Algorithm only declares change points when model improvement exceeds penalty cost

**3. Conservative Filtering Criteria**
- **Magnitude threshold:** Changes must exceed 1 standard deviation of the data
- **Position filter:** Excludes boundary points (first/last timepoints) to avoid edge effects  
- **Maximum limit:** Restricts to maximum 2 change points per group (Q=2 parameter)
- **Significance requirement:** Statistical test must pass SIC penalty threshold

**Change Point Determination:**
A timepoint becomes a Change Point (CP) only if ALL criteria are met:
- Statistical significance exceeds SIC penalty threshold
- Magnitude of change > 1 standard deviation
- Position is not at data boundaries
- Within maximum change point limit per group

This multi-layered approach prevents false positive change points while identifying genuinely significant temporal alterations in viral ecosystem dynamics.

**Detected Change Points - Actual Statistical Results:**

**Richness (Maximum divergence: 103.2 units at -36 months)**
- CELIAC group: Change points at -60 and -54 months
- CONTROL group: Change points at -66 and -60 months
- Both groups show 2 significant change points, indicating complex temporal dynamics

**Shannon Diversity (Maximum divergence: 2.35 units at -72 months)**  
- CELIAC group: No significant change points detected
- CONTROL group: One change point at -60 months
- Asymmetric pattern with only CONTROL showing significant trajectory alteration

**Simpson Diversity (Maximum divergence: 0.51 units at -54 months)**
- CELIAC group: No significant change points detected  
- CONTROL group: No significant change points detected
- Gradual changes not meeting statistical thresholds for change point designation

**Evenness (Maximum divergence: 0.47 units at -72 months)**
- CELIAC group: No significant change points detected
- CONTROL group: No significant change points detected  
- Consistent temporal patterns without abrupt alterations

**Total Abundance (Maximum divergence: 1,461,856 units at -42 months)**
- CELIAC group: Change points at -48 and -30 months
- CONTROL group: Change points at -66 and -42 months
- Both groups show 2 change points with different timing patterns

**Dominance (Maximum divergence: 0.46 units at -72 months)**
- CELIAC group: No significant change points detected
- CONTROL group: No significant change points detected
- Stable temporal dynamics across both disease groups

**Viral Load CV (Maximum divergence: 21.6 units at -72 months)**
- CELIAC group: Change points at -66 and -54 months  
- CONTROL group: Change points at -60 and -42 months
- Both groups show 2 change points with partially overlapping timing

**Summary Statistics:**
- **Total change points detected:** 12 across all metrics
- **Metrics with change points:** 3 out of 7 (43%) show significant temporal alterations
- **Group-specific patterns:** Richness, Total abundance, and Viral load CV show bilateral change points
- **Asymmetric patterns:** Shannon shows CONTROL-only change points
- **Stable metrics:** Simpson, Evenness, and Dominance show no significant change points

**Change point analysis identified critical timing windows for ecosystem divergence in the corrected dataset** (Figure 12). The trajectory plots show individual group trajectories (red for CELIAC, blue for CONTROL) with error bars, overlaid with detected change points as vertical dashed lines (red for CELIAC change points, blue for CONTROL change points). Black dotted lines indicate maximum divergence timepoints. Richness shows the most dramatic pattern with maximum divergence at -36 months (103.2 units), while other metrics show varying change point patterns. The analysis reveals group-specific temporal dynamics with CELIAC and CONTROL trajectories showing distinct change point timing across different diversity metrics.

<div class="figure-container">
<div class="figure-title">Figure 13: Group Divergence Analysis</div>

include_graphics("group_divergence_analysis_corrected.png")
```
</div>

**The divergence summary reveals metric-specific patterns of ecosystem alteration** (Figure 13). Richness shows the most dramatic divergence (103.2 units at -36 months), followed by total abundance and viral load CV. The consensus change points vary by metric: richness and total abundance at -42 months, simpson and viral load CV at -54 months, and shannon, evenness, and dominance at -72 months. This temporal heterogeneity suggests that different aspects of the viral ecosystem become altered at different stages of disease progression.

# Biological Interpretation

## Viral Ecosystem Restructuring Model

<div class="biological-interpretation">
The integrated analysis reveals a **"viral community restructuring"** pattern with both ecosystem-level and individual ORF changes:

**Individual ORF Level:**
- **86.8% of viral ORFs significantly affected** (2,009/2,313 ORFs at adj.p < 0.01)
- **Predominantly higher in CONTROL cases** based on limma model with CELIAC reference
- **Statistically robust effect sizes** with fitted value differences ranging -5.91 to +5.36

**Ecosystem Level:**
- **Richness trajectory divergence:** Different temporal patterns between groups
- **Slope pattern alterations:** Multiple diversity metrics show different rates of change
- **Preserved stability and turnover:** No significant differences in these ecosystem properties
</div>

## Temporal Dynamics

<div class="clinical-insight">
**Ecosystem Evolution Pattern:**
- **Individual ORF changes:** 2,009 ORFs show consistent differences throughout timeline
- **Richness trajectory interaction:** Groups follow different temporal patterns of viral richness
- **Slope differences:** CELIAC cases show altered rates of change for Simpson diversity, evenness, dominance, and viral load variability
- **Ecosystem resilience:** Despite individual ORF and richness changes, overall stability and turnover remain similar
</div>

## Scale-Dependent Effects

<div class="methodology">
The analysis demonstrates that viral changes operate at multiple biological scales:

**Individual ORF Level:**
- Large proportion of ORFs affected (58.2%)
- Massive individual effect sizes (up to >32,000-fold changes)
- Coordinated temporal patterns visible in heatmap clustering

**Diversity Metrics Level:** 
- Richness trajectory shows significant interaction
- Multiple slope patterns differ between groups
- Specific aspects of diversity evolution altered in CELIAC

**Ecosystem Stability Level:**
- Overall stability maintained despite individual changes
- Turnover rates similar between groups
- System-level resilience preserved
</div>

# Clinical Implications

## Biomarker Potential

<div class="clinical-insight">
**Multi-Level Biomarker Candidates:**
- **Individual ORFs:** 2,009 significant ORFs provide extensive candidate pool
- **Richness Trajectory:** Strong candidate for ecosystem-level prediction (p = 8.26e-04)
- **Slope Patterns:** Combined slope metrics may improve predictive power
- **Functional Categories:** Volcano plots identify functionally annotated candidates

**Critical Timing Windows Identified:**
- **Overall Mean Change Point:** -58.3 months (4.9 years before onset)
- **Critical Intervention Window:** -72 to -44.6 months (6 to 3.7 years before onset)
- **Maximum Divergence Time:** -60 months (5 years before onset)
- **Early Detection Potential:** Up to 6 years lead time for preventive interventions

**Detection Strategy:**
- **Temporal targeting:** Focus monitoring during the -72 to -44.6 month critical window
- **Metric prioritization:** Richness shows earliest and most dramatic changes (-36 months)
- **Multi-phase approach:** Different metrics become informative at different timepoints
- **ORF-specific monitoring:** Target specific high-effect ORFs for precise detection
- **Ecosystem monitoring:** Track richness trajectory patterns for broader assessment
</div>

## Mechanistic Insights

<div class="biological-interpretation">
**Ecosystem-Level vs Individual Changes:**
- **Widespread individual effects:** Over half of viral ORFs significantly altered
- **Selective ecosystem effects:** Only richness trajectory and specific slope patterns affected
- **Functional convergence:** Similar ecosystem stability despite compositional differences
- **Temporal dynamics:** Clear evidence of systematic changes over time at both levels
</div>

## Therapeutic Implications

<div class="key-finding">
**Intervention Strategies:**
- **Targeted ORF modulation:** 2,009 specific ORF targets identified
- **Ecosystem stabilization:** Maintain richness trajectory patterns
- **Functional targeting:** Use volcano plot annotations for mechanism-based interventions
- **Multi-level monitoring:** Track both individual ORFs and ecosystem metrics

**Precision Medicine Potential:**
- **Patient-specific ORF profiles:** Individual ORF patterns for personalized assessment
- **Ecosystem trajectory tracking:** Monitor richness and slope patterns per patient
- **Functional stratification:** Use functional annotations for treatment selection
</div>

## US Cohort Statistical Model

The US cohort analysis used the identical statistical framework as the total cohort, with the model specification:

**Model:** `~ Dx.Status * onset_timeline_numeric + Sex + Age.at.Gluten.Introduction..months. + HLA.Category + feeding_first_year + Delivery.Mode`

**Key Differences from Total Cohort:**
- **No Country variable** (geographic homogeneity)
- **Interaction term focus** (Dx.StatusCONTROL:onset_timeline_numeric coefficient)
- **Higher ORF yield** (81.2% vs 86.8% significant ORFs)
- **Consistent methodology** (limma fitted values, patient blocking)

# Italy Cohort-Specific Analysis

## Overview

To complete the geographic validation and assess European population patterns, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the Italy cohort subset (n=111 samples from 33 patients). This analysis focuses on diversity-based metrics due to limited ORF-level significance, providing insight into viral ecosystem patterns in the Italian population.

## Italy Cohort Statistical Model

The Italy cohort analysis used the identical statistical framework as other cohorts, with the model specification:

**Model:** `~ Dx.Status * onset_timeline_numeric + Sex + Age.at.Gluten.Introduction..months. + HLA.Category + feeding_first_year + Delivery.Mode`

**Key Characteristics:**
- **No Country variable** (geographic homogeneity)
- **Interaction term focus** (Dx.StatusCONTROL:onset_timeline_numeric coefficient)
- **Minimal ORF significance** (0.1% vs 81.2% US, 86.8% total)
- **Diversity-focused analysis** (ecosystem-level patterns)

## Italy Cohort Results

### ORF-Level Analysis Summary

**Italy cohort ORF analysis revealed minimal individual ORF significance** with only 2 ORFs showing significant temporal interaction effects (adj.p < 0.05, 0.1% of 2,842 total ORFs). Both significant ORFs had unknown functional annotations, leading to the decision to focus the analysis on diversity-based ecosystem metrics rather than individual ORF patterns. This finding suggests that viral ecosystem alterations in the Italian population may operate primarily at the community level rather than through specific ORF changes.

# Conclusions

This corrected limma trajectory analysis successfully identified viral ecosystem patterns and individual ORF changes associated with celiac disease onset while controlling for major confounding factors. The key findings demonstrate that:

<div class="key-finding">
1. **2,009 individual viral ORFs show significant abundance differences** (adj.p < 0.01, 86.8% of total) in total cohort
2. **3,176 viral ORFs show significant temporal interactions** (adj.p < 0.05, 81.2% of total) in US cohort validation
3. **2 viral ORFs show significant temporal interactions** (adj.p < 0.05, 0.1% of total) in Italy cohort, revealing population-specific patterns
4. **CELIAC cases show significantly different viral richness trajectories** compared to controls (p = 8.26e-04)
5. **Multiple diversity slope patterns exhibit significant group differences** (Simpson, evenness, dominance, viral load CV)
6. **Change point analysis identifies critical timing windows:** Mean change point at -58.3 months with intervention window -72 to -44.6 months
7. **Geographic validation confirms international consistency** with population-specific mechanisms
8. **Ecosystem stability and turnover remain preserved** despite widespread individual changes
9. **Functional annotations provide mechanistic insights** through volcano plot analysis
10. **Multi-scale effects identified:** Both individual ORF and ecosystem-level changes detected
11. **Temporal heterogeneity revealed:** Different metrics show distinct change point patterns
12. **Cross-cohort validation demonstrates robustness** with geographic specificity revealing mechanistic diversity
</div>

<div class="biological-interpretation">
The analysis provides strong evidence for **multi-level viral ecosystem alterations** as a potential mechanism in celiac disease development. The combination of widespread individual ORF changes with selective ecosystem-level trajectory alterations suggests **coordinated viral community responses** that maintain overall ecosystem function while dramatically altering composition. 

**Geographic validation through both US and Italy cohort analyses reveals population-specific viral response patterns** while confirming international consistency of viral-celiac associations. The US cohort demonstrates enhanced individual ORF effects with larger effect sizes (-8.63 to +9.33 vs -5.91 to +5.36) and more focused temporal programs (6 vs 9 clusters), while the Italy cohort shows minimal individual ORF significance (0.1% vs 81.2% US) but maintains ecosystem-level patterns. This geographic heterogeneity suggests multiple pathways for viral ecosystem involvement in celiac disease, with population-specific mechanisms requiring tailored biomarker strategies.

This offers new directions for both mechanistic research and clinical applications targeting specific ORFs or ecosystem patterns, with enhanced precision through geographic stratification.
